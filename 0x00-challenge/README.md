# Fix My Code Challenge
> Every file in this repository contains code that has a problem or bug and needs fixing
> . Initial commits of each files are the codes containig the bug causing undesirable results.

- 0-fizzbuzz.py
> This python code does the fizzbuzz, but initially displays fizz for 15 instead of fizzbuzzz
- 1-print\_square.js
> This javascript code prints a square, using the passed command line argument as size pf the square. Initially the parse int method converts the number to a hexadecimal, which causes undesirable results as the size should be in decimal form.
